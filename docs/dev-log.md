# Development Log

*Tracking our experimental work on the custom Copilot extension*

## July 3, 2025

### Session Goals
- Fork the vscode-copilot-chat repository
- Set up development environment for rapid iteration
- Configure workspace to use our custom fork instead of default Copilot Chat
- Begin real-time modifications to the collaborative frame

### Progress

#### âœ… Repository Setup
- [x] Cloned vscode-copilot-chat into `/workspaces/coer/copilot-fork`
- [x] Initial exploration of repository structure
- [x] Created documentation structure
- [x] npm install completed successfully
- [x] Build system analysis complete
- [x] Development workflow documented
- [x] Test build successful (npm run compile)

#### ðŸ”„ Current Tasks
- [x] Analyze package.json build scripts and dependencies
- [x] Examine main extension files (`src/extension.ts`, `src/base/extension.ts`)
- [x] Figure out build and development workflow
- [x] Test building the extension (âœ… Build successful in ~15s)
- [ ] Test launching extension in development mode
- [ ] Document how to replace default Copilot Chat with our fork

#### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. Test launching the extension (F5 in copilot-fork folder)
2. Verify our fork works as expected
3. Make first test modification (add custom identifier)
4. Set up our fork to replace default Copilot Chat
5. Begin implementing collaborative frame enhancements

### Notes and Discoveries

#### Repository Structure
- Standard VSCode extension structure with TypeScript
- Main entry point compiles to `./out/extension.js`
- Uses standard extension manifest in `package.json`

#### Build System Details
- **esbuild** for fast bundling (configured in `.esbuild.ts`)
- **npm run compile** - Development build
- **npm run watch** - Watch mode with automatic rebuilds
- **F5** launches development extension in new VSCode window
- Pre-configured launch.json with "Launch Copilot Extension - Watch Mode"

#### Development Workflow Discovered
1. Press F5 in VSCode (or use launch configuration)
2. New VSCode window opens with extension loaded
3. Watch mode rebuilds automatically on changes
4. Reload extension window to see updates

#### Key Questions
- âœ… How does the build system work? - Uses esbuild + TypeScript
- âœ… What's the development/testing workflow? - F5 launches test window
- ðŸ”„ How do we swap extensions during development? - Still investigating

### Challenges
- TBD

### Ideas for Collaborative Frame Enhancements
- TBD (will add as we progress)
